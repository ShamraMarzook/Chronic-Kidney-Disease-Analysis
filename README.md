# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE ANALYSIS

# INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease, also known as chronic renal disease is a major medical problem that damage the kidneys which results in a gradual loss of kidney function and decrease their ability to keep one healthy.Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse and delay the process, preventing it from being fatal.

Machine Learning is a rising field concerned with the study of huge and multiple variable data. It has a huge impact on health sector through an effective analysis of various chronic diseases for more accurate diagnosis and successful treatment. 

This work train and test the given factors which causes Chronic Kidney Disease and with the best performing machine learning model it can effortlessly predict the result of the patient with much higher accuracy because traditional methods can be faulty at certain times. Prediction in traditional method is done by doctors, prevention of human errors is not possible.

This work predominantly focused on, prediction of chronic kidney disease in patients using classification techniques of data mining. Thereby, down-staging it to stages that are more amenable to curative treatment.

First the dataset was obtained, and the data-preprocessing was done. Then feature selection and model evaluation and classification was done to obtain favorable results. My contribution to the project included both the data pre-processing as well as the model evaluation
